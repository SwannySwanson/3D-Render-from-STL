This code takes an .stl file and converts it into a 3D projection in the command terminal.

To use, enter the location of the .stl and initial size of the object. This code works best with a mouse, as the object follows the mouse curser, and the scroll wheel is used to zoom.

Throughout this project, I learned more about matrix math, point projection, collecting and storing external changing data, and much more.
